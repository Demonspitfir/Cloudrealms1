There is one problem that I have been having.
I haven't been able to get the whole set-up going.
I am trying to use /localhost/ MySQL, XAMPP, Etc. to Host the Site on my local computer. 
I was able to read the Readme and get things set-up after setting up all the other programs.

I got the MySQL database up-loaded. Then got things to start working; however, I am now running into Syntax Errors,
and <? or <?php errors. Where you have to chose one over the other and there are Syntax Error's after Syntax Errors showing up.
Was just curious if this was a new problem or an existing one.
